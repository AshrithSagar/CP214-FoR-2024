\section*{Problem 2}

An exam problem in statics has three unknown forces.
A student writes the following three equations (they know that they need three equations to find a unique solution) --- one for the force balance in the x-direction and the other two for the moment balance about two different points.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \( F_1 - \frac{1}{2} F_2 + \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} F_3 = 0 \)
    \item \( 2 F_1 + \frac{3}{2} F_2 = 0 \)
    \item \( \frac{5}{2} F_2 + \sqrt{2} F_3 = 0 \)
\end{enumerate}

Can the student solve for \( F_1 \), \( F_2 \), and \( F_3 \) uniquely from these equations?

\subsection*{Solution}

The given system of equations can be written in matrix form as follows:

\[
    \begin{bmatrix}
        1 & -\frac{1}{2} & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\
        2 & \frac{3}{2}  & 0                  \\
        0 & \frac{5}{2}  & \sqrt{2}
    \end{bmatrix}
    \begin{bmatrix}
        F_1 \\
        F_2 \\
        F_3
    \end{bmatrix}
    =
    \begin{bmatrix}
        0 \\
        0 \\
        0
    \end{bmatrix}
\]

Denote the system with \( \mathbf{A}\mathbf{x} = \mathbf{b} \), the determinant of which is given by
\[
    \left| \mathbf{A} \right| = \begin{vmatrix} 1 & -\frac{1}{2} & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\ 2 & \frac{3}{2} & 0 \\ 0 & \frac{5}{2} & \sqrt{2} \end{vmatrix}
    = 1 \begin{vmatrix} \frac{3}{2} & 0 \\ \frac{5}{2} & \sqrt{2} \end{vmatrix} - \Big(\frac{-1}{2}\Big) \begin{vmatrix} 2 & 0 \\ 0 & \sqrt{2} \end{vmatrix} + \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \begin{vmatrix} 2 & \frac{3}{2} \\ 0 & \frac{5}{2} \end{vmatrix}
    =\frac{3\sqrt{2}}{2} + \frac{2\sqrt{2}}{2} + \frac{5}{\sqrt{2}}
    = \frac{10}{\sqrt{2}}
\]
\[
    \implies \left| \mathbf{A} \right| = 5 \sqrt{2}
\]
Since the determinant of the matrix \( \mathbf{A} \) is non-zero, the system of equations \underline{has a unique solution}.
Further, we can see that the solution of the system is the trivial solution since the system is homogenous with a non-zero determinant.
Therefore, \( F_1 = F_2 = F_3 = 0 \),
Given the context of the question, we can see that there are no non-trivial solutions to the given system of equations.
