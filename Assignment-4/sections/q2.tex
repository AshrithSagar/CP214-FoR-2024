\section*{Problem 2}

A rigid body moving in \( \mathbb{R}^{2} \) has three degrees of freedom (two components of translation and one of rotation), a rigid body moving in \( \mathbb{R}^{3} \) has six degrees of freedom (three each of translation and rotation).
Show that a rigid body moving in \( \mathbb{R}^{n} \) will have \( \left(n+n^{2}\right) / 2 \) degrees of freedom.
How many are translational and how many are rotational?
