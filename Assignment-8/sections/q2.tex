Consider a cast iron dumbbell consisting of a cylinder connecting two solid spheres at either end of the cylinder.
The density of the dumbbell is \( 7500 \mathrm{~kg} / \mathrm{m}^{3} \).
The cylinder has a diameter of 4 cm and a length of 20 cm.
Each sphere has a diameter of 20 cm.
\begin{enumerate}[label= (\alph*)]
    \item Find the approximate Rotational Inertia Matrix \( \mathcal{I}^{b} \) in a frame \( \{b\} \) at the center of mass with axes aligned with the principal axes of inertia of the dumbbell.

    \item Write down the full Mass Matrix \( \mathcal{M}^{b}=\operatorname{BlockDiag}\left(m I, \mathcal{I}^{b}\right) \).

    \item For this part no need to compute your answer numerically.
          Show that in another frame \( \{\mathrm{a}\} \), we have \( \mathcal{M}^{a}=\operatorname{Ad}_{g_{a b}}^{T} \mathcal{M}^{b} \operatorname{Ad}_{g_{a b}} \).
          Is this a generalized version of the parallel axis theorem you learned at the beginning of this course? Yes/No?

          [Hint: Which scalar quantity remains invariant under frame transformation?]
\end{enumerate}
