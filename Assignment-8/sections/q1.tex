Show that the forward kinematics map for a manipulator is independent of the order in which rotations and translations are performed.

\subsection*{Solution}

The forward kinematics of a manipulator is described by a mapping \( g_{st} : Q \to SE (3) \)which describes the end-eﬀector configuration as a function of the robot joint variables, where \( Q \) is the joint space/configuration space of the manipulator consisting of all possible values of the joint variables of the robot.
For open-chain manipulators with \( p \) revolute joints and \( r \) prismatic joints, the configuration has \( p+r \) degrees of freedom and we have that \( Q \subseteq \mathbb{T}^{p} \times \mathbb{R}^{r} \), where \( \mathbb{T} \) is the \(p\)-torus, i.e., \( \mathbb{T}^{p} = \mathbb{S}^{1} \times \cdots \times \mathbb{S}^{1} \) (p times), with \( \mathbb{S}^{1} \) being the unit circle in the plane and \( \times \) denoting the Cartesian product/direct product of groups, and \( \mathbb{R}^{r} \) is the \(r\)-dimensional Euclidean space.
The general form of the forward kinematics map can be written as
\begin{equation}
    g_{st}(\theta)
    =
    g_{s l_1}(\theta_1)
    g_{l_1 l_2}(\theta_2)
    \cdots
    g_{l_{n-1} l_n}(\theta_n)
    g_{l_n t}
\end{equation}
where the frames are denoted successively by \( S \) (base frame), \( L_i \) (link \(i\) frame), and \( T \) (tool frame), and the relative transformation matrices between the frames are denoted by \( g_{ij} \) where the subscripts \( i \) and \( j \) denote the frames between which the transformation is defined.
In terms of twists, the forward kinematics map is given by the product of exponentials formula,
\begin{equation}
    g_{st}(\theta)
    =
    e^{\widehat{\xi}_1 \theta_1}
    e^{\widehat{\xi}_2 \theta_2}
    \cdots
    e^{\widehat{\xi}_n \theta_n}
    g_{st}(0)
\end{equation}
where \( \xi_{i} \) is the twist corresponding to the \(i\)-th joint axis in the reference \( (\theta = 0) \) conﬁguration.

In the case of a two degree of freedom manipulator, an example of which is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:2dof-manipulator}, the forward kinematics map can be calculated using the product of exponentials formula, which is invariant to the order in which the rotations and translations are performed.
The manipulator has two revolute joints with joint variables \( \theta_1 \) and \( \theta_2 \), and the forward kinematics map is given by
\begin{equation}
    g_{st}(\theta)
    =
    e^{\widehat{\xi}_1 \theta_1}
    e^{\widehat{\xi}_2 \theta_2}
    g_{st}(0)
\end{equation}
