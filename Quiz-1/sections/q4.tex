\section*{Problem 4}

A Mars rover moves with a velocity \(v\) on a flat ground as shown below.
The crawler belt of the rover has mass \(m\).
Determine the kinetic energy of the crawler belt, assuming its length is much larger than that of the radius of rover wheels. [Hint: Rover wheels are under pure rolling condition]
