\section*{Problem 2}

\textbf{Instantaneous Center of Rotation (ICR):}
Let us consider a rigid body in 3D performing a planar motion.
An example would be a vehicle driving on a flat road.
We pick a coordinate system for which the plane coincides with the motion plane of the rigid body.
Now, we pick one point \(r_0\) within the rigid body as the reference point.
We are free to pick any point we want.
For our vehicle, we could, e.g., use the center of the rear axle.
If we pick another point \(r\) within the rigid body (for our vehicle, maybe the left front tire), then we can express the velocity of that point via \(\dot r=\dot r_0 + \Omega\times(r-r_0)\), where \( \Omega \) is the angular velocity vector.
Now answer the following,
\begin{enumerate}[label= (\alph*)]
    \item Prove that the angular velocity vector \( \Omega \) does not depend on the choice of \(r_0\).
    \item Prove that for any given point in time, we can find a point \(r\), for which \(\dot r  = 0\).
          We call this point the instantaneous center of rotation and that it does not need to lie inside the rigid body.
\end{enumerate}
