\subsection*{Solution}

\subsubsection*{(a) \( \vec{b} \times \vec{c} = \vec{c} \times \vec{b} \)}

The equation is sometimes true.

The cross product of two vectors is not commutative in general, i.e., \( \vec{a} \times \vec{b} \neq \vec{b} \times \vec{a} \).
In fact, the cross product of two vectors is anti-commutative, i.e., \( \vec{a} \times \vec{b} = -\vec{b} \times \vec{a} \).

The equation is only valid when the two vectors are parallel or anti-parallel, or the vector is the zero vector.
Therefore, the equation is sometimes true.

\subsubsection*{(b) \( \vec{b} \times \vec{c} = \vec{c} \cdot \vec{b} \)}

The equation is nonsense.

The LHS of the equation is a vector due to the cross product.
The RHS of the equation is a scalar due to the dot product.

The cross product of two vectors results in a vector that is orthogonal to the plane formed by the two vectors.
The dot product of two vectors results in a scalar that is the projection of one vector onto the other vector.

Therefore, it makes no sense to use them like this.

\subsubsection*{(c) \( \vec{c} \cdot (\vec{a} \times \vec{b}) = \vec{b} \cdot (\vec{c} \times \vec{a}) \)}

This equation is always true.

The quantity \( \vec{a} \cdot (\vec{b} \times \vec{c}) \) denotes the \textit{scalar triple product}.
Scalar triple products have the property that they are invariant to cyclic shifts, as above.

We can show this in general, by first proving a trivial lemma.

\textbf{Lemma:} For any three vectors \( \vec{a} \), \( \vec{b} \), and \( \vec{c} \), the following identity holds:
\begin{equation*}
    \vec{p} \cdot (\vec{p} \times \vec{q}) = 0
\end{equation*}

\textbf{Proof:}
The cross product of two vectors is orthogonal to the plane formed by the two vectors, i.e., the \( \vec{p} \times \vec{q} \) is orthogonal to \( \vec{p} \).
Since the dot product of a vector with an orthogonal vector to it is zero, the result follows.

Now, we consider two vectors \( \vec{A} \) and \( \vec{B} \), where \( \vec{A} = (\vec{b} + \vec{c}) \) and \( \vec{B} = ((\vec{b} + \vec{c}) \times \vec{a}) \).
By the above lemma, we see that \( \vec{A} \cdot \vec{B} = 0 \) by noting that \( \vec{B} = \vec{A} \times \vec{a} \).
\begin{equation*}
    (\vec{b} + \vec{c}) \cdot ((\vec{b} + \vec{c}) \times \vec{a}) = 0
\end{equation*}
Expanding this expression, we get
\[
    (\vec{b} + \vec{c}) \cdot (\vec{b} \times \vec{a} + \vec{c} \times \vec{a}) = 0
\]
\[
    \implies \vec{b} \cdot (\vec{b} \times \vec{a}) + \vec{b} \cdot (\vec{c} \times \vec{a}) + \vec{c} \cdot (\vec{b} \times \vec{a}) + \vec{c} \cdot (\vec{c} \times \vec{a}) = 0
\]
Using the above lemma, we see that the first and fourth terms are zero.
\[
    \implies \vec{b} \cdot (\vec{c} \times \vec{a}) + \vec{c} \cdot (\vec{b} \times \vec{a}) = 0
\]
Now, using the anti-commutativity property of the cross product, we see that \( \vec{a} \times \vec{b} = -\vec{b} \times \vec{a} \).
\[
    \implies \vec{b} \cdot (\vec{c} \times \vec{a}) - \vec{c} \cdot (\vec{a} \times \vec{b}) = 0
\]
\[
    \therefore \vec{c} \cdot (\vec{a} \times \vec{b}) = \vec{b} \cdot (\vec{c} \times \vec{a})
\]
Hence, the equation is always true.
