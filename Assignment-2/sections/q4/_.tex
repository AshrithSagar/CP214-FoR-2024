\section*{Problem 4}

A robot arm AB is rotating about point A with \( \omega_{AB} = 5 \text{rad/s} \) and \( \dot\omega_{AB} = 2 \text{rad/s} \).
Meanwhile, the forearm BC is rotating at a constant angular speed with respect to AB of \( \omega_{BC/AB} = 3 \text{rad/s} \).
Gravity cannot be neglected.
At the instant shown, find the net force acting on the object P, which has mass \( m = 1\text{kg} \).
