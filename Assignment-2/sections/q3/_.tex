\section*{Problem 3}

An autonomous car needs to maintain a constant speed \( v \) as it moves along the curved surface of a hill, which can be approximated as a circle with radius \( R \).
The car starts from point O at the base of the hill.
The car's ``AI'' must ensure it does not lift off the ground as it reaches the top of the hill.
Therefore, determine the maximum speed \( v_{\max} \) the AI should set to prevent the car from leaving the surface at the hill's peak.
