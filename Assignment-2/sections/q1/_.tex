\section*{Problem 1}

A and B carts are connected by a massless spring.
The carts are pulled to the left with a force F and to the right with a force T, as shown in the below figure.
Assume the wheels of the carts are massless and frictionless.
Draw free-body diagrams of
\begin{itemize}[itemsep=3pt,parsep=0pt,topsep=5pt,partopsep=0pt]
    \item Cart A
    \item Cart B
    \item Cart A and B are considered as a system together
\end{itemize}
