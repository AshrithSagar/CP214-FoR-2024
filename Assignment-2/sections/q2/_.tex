\section*{Problem 2}

For the bicycle shown in the figure, assume the mass of the bicycle (and possibly the rider) to be a point mass located at C.
A vertical downward force \( \vec{F} \) is applied on the front pedal.

\begin{enumerate}[label = (\alph*)]
    \item Draw a free-body diagram of the front wheel.
    \item Draw a free-body diagram of the back wheel.
    \item Draw a free-body diagram of the entire bicycle.
\end{enumerate}
